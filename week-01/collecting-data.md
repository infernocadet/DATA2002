# collecting data

## revision

- a **sample** is a part of a **population**
- a **parameter** is a **numerical fact** about a **population**
- a **parameter** cant be determined exactly, but it can be **estimated**
- a **statistic** can be computed from a **sample**, and then used to **estimate a parameter**.
- a statistic summarises what the researcher knows. a parameter is what the researcher wants to know.
- when estimating a parameter, one issue is accuracy - how close is the estimated statistic to the true (unknown) parameter?

a **p-value** is the probability that you would've gotten a test statistic like the one you actually calculated, **assuming that the null hypothesis was true**. now, if the p-value were small, its basically saying that theres a small chance that you would've actually calculated that statistic, which likely points to the fact that the null hypothesis is most likely false.

### sampling

`sampling` is the process of selecting a subset of representative observations from a particular population of interest, so that characteristics of the subset can be used to draw conclusions or make inferences about the entire population.

we sample because:

- reduces number of measurements
- saves time, money etc
- essential in destructive testing
- ^ all compared to population testing

### types of biases

- selection bias
- recall bias
- sensitive questions
- misinterpret the questions
- wording of question

## studies

observational study vs controlled experiment is like overt/covert. in an observational study, we measure or survey members in a sample without trying to impact them. in a controlled experiement, we assign groups of people and apply some treatment to see the impact.
